# Overview

This directory contains some examples to disburden the process of getting started with Go programming.

Currently there is only one very simple example but this hopefully changes in the future.
See the respective [github-repo](https://github.com/fsfw-dresden/hello-world-collection) for updates.
Of course you are welcome to suggest additional content by your self, e. g., via pull request.
