# Overview

This directory contains some examples to disburden the process of getting started with C programming.

Currently there is only one very simple example but this hopefully changes in the future.

* 01_hello-world
  - simple hello-world-program. See source code for compiling instructions.


# TODO:
Add examples for the following topics

* nontrivial linking
* make, cmake
* unittest
